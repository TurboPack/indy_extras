Here are some things that I ask other people for.

1. A Graphics logo for TurusTLS.  My idea for a logo is a bull’s head since “Taurus” is the Latin word for “bull”  The head should have horns that face towards the user, a nose ring, and steam coming out of the nostrils.  The expression should be “mean”.  This logo will be used in the documentation, probably a website, as well as “Built with TaurusTLS” graphics that a developer may use in their application.

2. Graphics of various sizes that indicate “Build with TaurusTLS” for application developers to use in their software and documentation.  This would also help developers comply with TaurusTLS’s licensing.  This is akin to what Indy (Internet Direct) has at https://www.indyproject.org/license/logos/ .

3. TaurusTLS should have a website.  This will be used to provide information for developers about TaurusTLS, redistribute OpenSSL per-compiled binaries required by various platforms, licensing information, and downloads.  I would suggest the URL http://www.taurustls.org .  I can not afford hosting for such a website especially since TLS is required by many browsers and Google insists on it.

4. TaurusTLS should be made functional on ALL platforms that Embarcadero RAD Studio supports. This is something I need a lot of assistance with since I don’t have the capabilities to test for MacOS, iOS, and Android.

5. Someone needs to review the code I have to find bugs and issues that I’m not seeing.  This also goes into item number 4.

6. Someone should make a FireMonkey version of the FTP Client demo program.   This demo program would also be a great way to test TaurusTLS functionality on various platforms that I am unable to test.  In other words, eat your dog food.
