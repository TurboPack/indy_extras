Here are some things that I ask other people for.

1. TaurusTLS should be made functional on ALL platforms that Embarcadero RAD Studio supports. This is something I need a lot of assistance with since I don’t have the capabilities to test for MacOS, iOS, and Android.

2. Someone needs to review the code I have to find bugs and issues that I’m not seeing.  This also goes into item number 1.
